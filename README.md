# Go Practice Repository

Welcome to my Go practice repository! ðŸŽ‰

In this repository, I will be practicing and learning the Go programming language by working through examples and tutorials from two primary resources:

1. **[Official Go Documentation](https://go.dev/doc/)**  
   This is the primary resource for understanding Go's core concepts, language specifications, and advanced topics.

2. **[Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)**  
   A hands-on resource with practical examples that help in understanding Go concepts through code snippets.

## Purpose of This Repository
The main goal of this repository is to document my journey in learning Go and to serve as a reference for future projects. Here, youâ€™ll find:

- Code snippets for practicing Go concepts.
- Notes and comments explaining the code.
- Solutions to exercises from the resources mentioned above.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the files and learn alongside me. Each folder or file will have a specific topic or example that I worked on, with explanations where necessary.
